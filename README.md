GetFresh, a web app helping shoppers find pop-up farmers markets.

Contributors: Blake Bagwell, Calder Marshall, Steven Rodriguez, Aaron White.

Description:

This app makes use of a United States Department of Agriculture API to populate a list of farmers markets, based upon a zip code entered by a user.  The Google maps API was implemented to make this possible.  Currently, it is only local to the United States.  In addition, a list of items that are typically available for sale at each individual market is included.  Visitors to GetFresh can also make use of a search function that takes ingredients as values and returns recipes for dishes based upon what they have or are planning to purchase at market.
